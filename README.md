# fast-api-e-commerce
Project to show skills on fast api, testing fast api with Async endpoints <br>

Project is not productions ready, is just to display skills, obviously much more <br>
thought is required.


#  


# Things to improve.
1 - The endpoint talk directly to the MongoDB database, the database should <br>
have it's own microservice and applications should request data to the database <br>
microservice by REST API or GraphQL.... <br>
2 - The endpoints need to add authentications. <br>
3 - CI/CD needs to be done.
